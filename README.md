# Ethernote

My first attempt to write a smart contract.
This is a decentralized note taking application inspired by Evernote.

A note consists in:
- Title.
- Comment.
- Editable (enabled/disabled).
- Timestamp.

Functions:
- pushNote.
- editNote in a certain position.
- toggleEditable (true or false).
- getNote returns a certain position.
- getNotes returns an array of notes.

Restriction:
- Only owner can edit
